    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    Yeah, I was in the dark<br>
    I was falling hard<br>
    With an open heart (I'm wide awake)<br>
    How did I read the stars so wrong?<br>
    (I'm wide awake)<br>
    And now it's clear to me<br>
    That everything you see<br>
    Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)<br>
    Yeah, I was dreaming for so long<br>
    I wish I knew then, what I know now<br>
    Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down<br>
    Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet<br>
    'Til I woke up on, on the concrete<br>
    Falling from cloud nine<br>
    Crashing from the high<br>
    I'm letting go tonight<br>
    Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    Not losing any sleep<br>
    I picked up every piece<br>
    And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)<br>
    Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)<br>
    Yeah, I am born again<br>
    Out of the lion's den<br>
    I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)<br>
    The story's over now, the end<br>
    I wish I knew then, what I know now<br>
    Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down<br>
    Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet<br>
    'Til I woke up on, on the concrete<br>
    Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)<br>
    Crashing from the high<br>
    I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)<br>
    I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)<br>
    Thunder rumbling<br>
    Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)<br>
    I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)<br>
    God knows that I tried<br>
    Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)<br>
    I'm not blind anymore<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)<br>
    Crashing from the high<br>
    You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)<br>
    I'm falling from cloud nine<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
    I'm wide awake<br>
